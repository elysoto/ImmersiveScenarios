description=Tips:
description=[spoiler]Find a belt, a flashlight, and a one handed weapon. You are hungry and thirsty, find food quickly or you will be too weak to fight back. If you make noise or fight, keep moving, they will be coming. You are weak and slow, and can only take on very few at a time. Find pills to help you sleep. Staircases are dangerous areas. Beware of barricaded areas.[/spoiler]
